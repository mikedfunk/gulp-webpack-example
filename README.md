# Gulp Webpack example
Very simple example of using gulp and webpack together.

## Setup and usage
1. `npm install`
2. `./node_modules/.bin/gulp` to build
3. `./node_modules/.bin/gulp watch` to watch for changes
4. `./node_modules/.bin/webpack` to build without gulp
5. `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch` to watch for changes without gulp
